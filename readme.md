My Coffee 

My Coffee is a place where you can learn about all the different kinds of coffee around the world. Here you can find the name and origin of the coffee. If a specific coffee catches your interest,
you can read about the process and how its made. Why stop there you can also add a specific coffee to your favorites so you can easily access them from one location. We also give you the ability to add comments under a specific coffee so other users can learn from you and each other. Maybe slip in some family secrets.
